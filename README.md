# hw-05-scheduler

This project we were tasked with completeing a work scheduler. The idea is to create a grid utilizing dom manipulation and the ability to store data to local storage. 
# Installation

I pulled the png files from Github from the gt-atl-fsf-ft-08-2020 repo. The remainder of the formatting was from Boot Strap, javaScript, and jQuery. The time was also referenced using moments.js.

# Usage
This is a scheduler that can be used to know what hour of the day it is and what upcoming events you have stored.
